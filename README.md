# UPS Sales Lead Repository

## Category: Supply Chain & Transportation Network

    Business Problem Statement: Build a repository to give Sales a lead on clients who are using UPS Services, but use a competitor to ship (FedEx, DHL, others). For example, we have a client who uses us for Brokerage and Warehouse services,  but not for shipping . We want to feed the Marketing/Sales Department that lead for them to get the client to ship with UPS instead of our competitor.
    Key Considerations:
        Build a database repository (client data, carrier data etc.)
        UI Interface to help sales team with potential leads.
        Build API that will feed into this repository

We also planned to connect to azure but could not get that working.
